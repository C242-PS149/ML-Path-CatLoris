# Machine Learning Model

![Machine Learning Model](https://www.linkpicture.com/)
The first model is for classifying food pictures into 14 categories in which we will be able to calculate the nutrition of this food. For the model, we built a sequential model using Tensorflow and Keras API. We use transfer learning MobileNetV2. Our input are trained through some parts of the MobileNetV2 layers. Then the output is flattened. After that, it is then passed into a Deep Neural Network with Dropout Layers.

For the second model we use KNN for product based recommendation. The recommendation is based on the Body Mass Index, age, fat level.
